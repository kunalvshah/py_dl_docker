Hello neighbours,

we are in Tower 16, flat 1002 and frequently we observe that ciggrate butts and other rubbish is thrown from floors above 1002.

This might be your blind spot but we have extended planter section and all the rubbish thrown from above does not fall on 0 floor but in our planter section, sometimes damaging our plants and also making it a big mess for us to clean.

So I request everyone above 1002, please do not through garbage from your balcony.

As communicated to you by VCC, other groups and citizens of the township, we reject the decision taken by the ATM for the infrastructure amount adjustment and demand more transparency and involvement.
